Anatomical Composition
Skeletal System: Cows have a complex skeletal structure, including bones that support their large body.
Muscular System: Their muscles contribute to movement and body structure, essential for both mobility and producing meat.
Digestive System: Cows are ruminants, meaning they have a unique stomach with four compartments (rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum) that help them digest fibrous plant material.
Biological Composition
Cells: Like all animals, cows are made up of various types of cells, including muscle cells, nerve cells, and epithelial cells.
Tissues: These cells form tissues such as muscle tissue, connective tissue, and nervous tissue.
